# Installation

## Requirements

git clone https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant-pool
cd ./adamant-pool

Parameters:

* `node` <string, array> List of nodes for pool’s API work, obligatorily
* `address` <string> The delegate’s ADM wallet address, obligatorily

* `reward_percentage` <number> The percentage of forged amount that will be sent to voters. Default: 80
* `minpayout` <number> Minimal sum for transfer in the end of payout period (in ADM). If the amount is not enough, the payment will be postponed to the next period. Default: 10

* `considerownvote` <boolean> Whether to consider your own vote (can you vote for the delegate for yourself). Default: false
* `maintenancewallet` <string> Wallet to transfer delegate share (100-reward_percentage) to. If the wallet is not set, this amount will remain on the delegate’s wallet.
* `slack` <string> Token for Slack alerts for the pool’s administrator. No alerts if not set.

* `port` <number> Port for connecting the web interface. The web interface is available at http://IP:port. Default: 36667

## Launching

You can start the pool with the `node app` command, but we recommend to use a process manager for this purpose.

```
pm2 start --name adamantpool app.js 
```

## Add pool to cron

```
crontab -e
```

Add string:

```
@reboot cd /home/adamant/adamant-pool && pm2 start --name adamantpool app.js
```
